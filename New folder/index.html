    <p>look into javascript tracking possibly??? for issues with not getting rid of auto cursor.... changed 
    body within CSS to instead of saying "none;" I changed it to the url link, i even deleted the auto function so it doesnt fallback as the auto pointer within the body. so far cant get rid of it. 
    Also tried different browsers and settings within the browser of duckduckgo and none were available. also tried resizing the pixels. also tried developer options to see if it put up any issues and none were showing... even tried changing the body CSS pointer tag from none to custom url link "cursor: url('https://www.rw-designer.com/cursor-view/133032.png'), auto;"
    even tried deleting auto after the url to delete the auto fall back feature... when i added the url link and looked at developer options it just showed it with a line through it and didnt throw up any error messages, im assuming it was showing up as basically a duplicate callout from the other url link for the custom cursor CSS tag?</p>

<p>    
    OK! were getting somewhere now... adding details to  the page gets rid of the default pointer only in the areas that html is displayed.</p>
  <br>
  <br>

  <footer>  
    might try to add a giant blank space at the bottom with a bunch of breaks so it fills it out and wont have the default cursor anywhere</p>
